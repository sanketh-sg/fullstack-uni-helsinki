# React
The .reduce() method takes an array and reduces it to a single value, like a sum, product, or even a new array.
Basic structure
```js
array.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {return newAccumulatorValue;}, initialValue);

```
We go through the list of parts, acc is sum is set to initial value 0 and curVal is part object and we return acc + part.exercise
